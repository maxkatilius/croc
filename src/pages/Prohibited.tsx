			<h4>The Clarkey Two-Hand</h4>

				While you can switch hands or use both during general gameplay,
				during critical moments of smackdowns and snatchdowns, it's a
				one-hand operation. Ensure only one hand is in action during
				these maneuvers.

			<p>
				This means you can't hold a card ready to play while also
				grabbing (or preparing to grab) a face-down card with your other
				hand to smackdown immediately after.
